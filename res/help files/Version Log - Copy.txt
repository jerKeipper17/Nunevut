May 16th, 2015

Worked On: 
   Created a MapObject class (for future GameMaps)

Vers. 0.00145 Alpha
May 19th, 2015

Worked On: 
   Finished editing Warp class and its where it sets a player
   Used the timerBar inside NPC to make every NPC change their actions alone
      * This uses a list of ints to pass into the movementObject => movement style
   Made MapObjects extend BasicGameState in order to use the fading transitions
   Created a MapManager <the original idea for this was so I could position players on warping>
   Created a third map and warping between each works
      * I do have to add where I want the player to be rendered after warping, instead of old position
   Created the start of a warp manager
      * To be used simlar to a map manager, added to the map and used by the map manager to set start locations for player

Goals: 
  make sure states actually pause 
  create/alter collisions for entering battle
  create collision <entity> lists for map
  create chests
  create dialog

Vers. 0.00175 Alpha
May 26th, 2015

Worked On: 
   Fixed MapManager/WarpManager - warp contains the side it wants players to go to, the state id of where it goes, and the warp id inside that state it corresponds to
   Therefore, I can warp to a map, be pointed in the right direction, and still have the fade-in/out transition
   I am going to say a multi-map(state) is achieved, but I am adding smooth multi-state to the goals

Goals: 
  make sure states actually pause 
  create/alter collisions for entering battle
  create collision <entity> lists for map
  create chests
  create dialog

  Class Specific:

		  a) Ex.

Proof of Concept: 
  *Working Player/NPC/Entity collision
  *Working Map collision
  *multi-map(state), 
  smooth multi-states (map, battle, menu, partymenu),
